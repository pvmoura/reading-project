one of my favorite things about the community here in reading it depends where you live also but most memorable for me is on Fidelity Street all the neighbors know each other in this is me as an adult we will bring the grill out and every neighbor will bring food so they'll be cooking inside their houses over the girls outside all the kids playing so that was a really good memory for me it's just seeing just those blocks even the community itself they would just bring everything I do a close everything down and everybody will be together hanging out and drinking
