what's so great about reading today and reading yesterday as I've gotten to put the two together I actually was on the train leaving from the Franklin station and going to Philadelphia and just this last summer we finished a mural of a train so it sort of brought the Two Worlds together from the 1960s into the 2016 so to see the tube come together and then here we are at the station again with an art project and I'm an artist kind of a great circle that's been made
