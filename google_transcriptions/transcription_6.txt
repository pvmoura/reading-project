I had a senior once that became homeless and had to find a place and I was able to go get a place for him I had some friends and some connections and I actually went and got the U-Haul truck myself my husband my daughter and my children all help move this this elderly 80 year old gentleman into a nice apartment that he had his stuff that it in a storage because he he didn't know where to go and they threw him out in the streets and we paid for his rent for one month and we were able to help him situate himself and he was he came back a very happy man you know and it was good to see that he had a place to say and I didn't care that I had to spend my own money that's what we're here for cuz I always say what what's mine is not mine when we're blessed we bless others that's the way we're supposed to do
