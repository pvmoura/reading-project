one of my favorite things about the community here and reading it depends where you live also but %HESITATION most memorable for me is on fidelity street all the neighbors know each other and this is me as an adult we will bring the grill out and every neighbor will bring food so they'll be cooking inside their houses their be that grows outside all the kids planes so that was a really good memory for me as a scene just those blocks even the community itself they would just bring everything out there close everything down and everybody will be together hang around joking
